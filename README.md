# Scootin

A showcase website thought for a fictitious scooter rental company.

No code website builders don’t allow a full customization experience. With this project, I tried the Jamstack architecture to provide to non-developers a way to add content to their website whithout
loosing any customization freedom.

Don’t judge the code quality, it’s an old junior project so it is pretty messy. At least, the result answer to the constraints I fixed to myself.
