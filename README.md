# Scootin

A showcase website thought for a fictitious scooter rental company.

With this project, I tried the Jamstack architecture to provide to non-developers a way to add content to their website whithout
loosing any customization freedom. It was thought to be an alternative to no-code website builders.

Itâ€™s an old junior project so the code is pretty messy, but at least, it end up with a result that answer to the constraints fixed.
