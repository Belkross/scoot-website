      h3: How it works
      article1:
        title: How do I download the app?
        description:
          To download the Scoot app, you can search “Scoot” in both the App and
          Google Play stores.   An even simpler way to do it would be to click
          the relevant link at the bottom of this page and you’ll be re-directed
          to the correct page.
      article2:
        title: Can I find a nearby Scoots?
        description:
          Definitely! Simply open up the app and allow us to find your location
          while using it. We'll show you all of the closest Scoots and some
          extra useful information.
      article3:
        title: Do I need a license to ride?
        description:
          Yup! We provide information inside the app regarding local laws and
          the license you need to be able to ride our Scoots.
    sectionB:
      h3: Safe driving
      article1:
        title: Should I wear a helmet?
        description:
          Yes, please do! All cities have different laws. But we strongly
          strongly strongly recommend always wearing a helmet regardless of the
          local laws. We like you and we want you to be as safe as possible
          while Scooting.
      article2:
        title: How about the rules & regulations?
        description:
          Now is not the time to be a rule breaker. Be sure you're complying
          with all local laws and regulations. Also, just be a good human being.
          Be sure not to park your Scoot where it can block access to buildings
          or get in people's way.
      article3:
        title: What if I damage my Scoot?
        description:
          Be sure to read our terms and conditions carefully. Not the most fun
          job we know but we make it as clear as possible. There's an option to
          add insurance for each trip, or you can sign up for annual insurance
          if you're a regular Scooter.
